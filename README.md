# Fundamentals-of-Computer-Science-1---Final-Project

These are the activities and projects that I completed throughout my first computer science course at Auburn: Fundamentals of Computer Science 1. 

Many of the activities and projects build on top of one another so some files may be missing in activities and projects. I just wanted to share the progress that I made.

To see the final result of both the projects and activities, go to the 11th of each. That was our final activity and project.

Throughout these projects I learned some fundamentals of OOR such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 

I also learned how to properly provide Javadoc's for when I am on a team.
